## Learning how to use the snakemake pipelining language
A [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/18/3/530/2562749) that compare the use of a variety of workflows:

Followed the tutorial in this page: https://slowkow.com/notes/snakemake-tutorial/. The only varoiation is that I had to install graphviz tool using: `conda install -c anaconda graphviz` to be able to visualize the workflow.

When done with the basic tutorial I need to master how I can use it for the accreditation work. This is the best place to begin: https://snakemake.bitbucket.io/snakemake-tutorial.html

Finally, I need to go through the [carpentries tutorial](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/hpc-python/discuss/).

I can also use the documentation as a reference material: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

## The plan

Get the pipeline working then I can use it for the analysis for varinat calling pipeline. This will make it very easy for us to reproduce the pipeline in the future.
